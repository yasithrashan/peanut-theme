# Peanut Theme

A warm, comfortable VS Code theme with carefully selected peanut-inspired colors. Designed for developers who prefer light themes that reduce eye strain during long coding sessions.

## Why Peanut Theme?

**Easy on the eyes** - Warm tones and balanced contrast reduce fatigue during extended coding sessions.

**Thoughtful colors** - Each syntax element uses distinct, purposeful colors that make code easy to scan and understand at a glance.

**Clean interface** - Minimal UI styling keeps your focus on the code, not the chrome.

**Versatile** - Works beautifully across JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML, CSS, Markdown, and more.
